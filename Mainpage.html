                <h2>Rooms</h2>
                <p>If you click the "Rooms"-button you will find yourself in a page filled with chatrooms. Every room has a name, a description and a capacity. The name and the description of the room gives you some hint about the overall nature of that
                    specific room. The capacity of the room tells you how many free slots there are in the room. If you decide to join a room, the chat area will open! ;)</p>
                <h2>Speed dating</h2>
                <p>As said before, we are no ordinary dating service! The chit-chat with other users happens in the chatrooms mentioned above. Once you join in one you'll have to wait until the room is filled with people. After the room is filled the game
                    begins. The service will "force" you to have a conversation with every other people in your room. There is a couple of minutes to get to know each other until the game gives you a new partner to chat with. ;)</p>
                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>You can find your own profile from the "Profile"-page. You can update your photo and personal description there! :)</p>
                <h2>People behind the service</h2>
                <p>Hi there! We are two IT-students from the Metropolia of Applied Sciences! This webservice done as a project for the school. </p>
